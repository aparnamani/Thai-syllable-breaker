# Thai-syllable-breaker

Finite state machine that identiﬁes syllables in Thai text. Thai uses a phonetic alphabet of consonants, vowels, and tone marks, but does not use space to separate words or syllables. Deterministic refers to the uniqueness of the computation.
The input ﬁle is utf-8 encoded and the path to the ﬁle is read as a command line argument. The lines in the ﬁle are combined and start processing the input by character.
